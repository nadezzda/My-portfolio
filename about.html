                <h2>Hi, I am Nadiia Malichenko</h2>
                <h4>Web developer from Ukraine 🇺🇦</h4>
                <hr>
                <p>Let me tell you about myself.<br>
                    During the work, it was determined that I have a narrow-boned, fragile body type. I came to this conclusion based on the measurements I took (for example, from the small circumference of the ankle and wrist, narrow chest and thin neck). Almost all indicators are normal, according to my body type. From which we can conclude that I have a low probability of developing diseases associated with excess weight and other non-infectious diseases associated with an inactive lifestyle.
                    The assessment of the functional state also indicates that my body is normal. Orthostatic test is based on the fact that the tone of the sympathetic part of the autonomic nervous system and, accordingly, the heart rate increase when moving from a horizontal position (clinostatic) to a vertical (orthostatic). A normal reaction to the test is an increase in heart rate by 10-16 beats in 1 minute immediately after lifting.
                    Therefore, anthropometric measurements gave me the opportunity to determine the level and features of physical development, the degree of its correspondence to age and gender, deviations in it, as well as to evaluate changes in my physical development that occur under the influence of physical exercises and sports. My level of physical development corresponds to my age, gender and body type.</p>
